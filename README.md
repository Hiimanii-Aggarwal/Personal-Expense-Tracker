## Description

The **Expense Tracker** is a Python-based desktop application that helps users manage their expenses efficiently. 
Users can add expenses, categorize them, visualize spending trends using graphs, and save their data. 
This project uses **Tkinter** for the graphical user interface (GUI) and **Matplotlib** for data visualization.

## Features

- Add Expenses: Users can input expenses with categories such as food, transport, utilities, and more.
- View Expenses: Display a list of all expenses with amounts, categories, and dates.
- Total Expenses: Calculate and display the total amount spent.
- Visualize Expenses: Generate bar charts showing the distribution of expenses by category.
- Save Expenses: Save the expense data in a JSON file (`expenses.json`) for future reference.
- Exit: Easily close the application.

- **Python 3.x**
